title: Why the minimal-blog is there?
category: Post

Recently, I set up a blog with Worldpress. It is powerful but seems too tedious. As a programmer, I favor somthing simple and powerful.
Later I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which in my opinion achives an elegant balance between simplicity and functionality. It 
does what you tell it to do — no more, no less.  

Then my Blog came to birth by the help of Jekyll. I can focus on the content by writing, without considering the format, the wideget and 
so on. At the same time, I preserve the freedom of modifying my site, when I need a small amendment or really want to change it.  

Additionally, Jekyll is deeply intergrated with GitHub. You can host your site on GitHub completely free and my site also lives on GitHub now. 
I really recommend this combination and here I share my blog templete. If it helps you to set up your site, I will be really happy!
