Some bugs are fixed.  

A new page schedule is added, which is useful at least for me.  

To use the schedule page, you could edit the files data/schedule_list1.yml, data/schedule_list2.yml. If you need only one schedule or more, list.html is the right place to go. Delete or repeat the code block of a schedule.

Have fun :-)
